                        <p class="pfaq"><bold>1. How does DKB Grievance Redressal System works? </bold></p>
                        <p>We, at Didi Ke Bolo (DKB) Grievance Redressal System put the public users, clerks, minister and the chief minister herself on the same platform. Here, a public user may lodge a complaint with any policy, schemes of the West Bengal Government here directly and the concerned ministry will resolve the issue. The best part of this system is that the chief minister herself is monitoring the whole system. Here users can also give a feedback after the issue has been resolved.</p>
                        <p class="pfaq"><bold>2. How to lodge a complaint in DKB Grievance Redressal System?</bold></p>
                        <p>There are two ways to lodge a complaint, one is the user himself can register on the portal and other is by calling the clerk. You can share the details of the issue with the clerk, after which the clerk will give an issue id. You will also get a message when your issue is resolved.</p>
                        <p class="pfaq"><bold>3. I don?t have internet connectivity in my area, how can I lodge a complaint?</bold></p>
                        <p>You can still lodge a complaint by calling the clerk. The clerk will give you an issue id of the issue.</p>
